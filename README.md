# InfluxDB Client Tools

This is my collection of helper scripts to interact with InfluxDB via the
client libraries.

## Client Libraries

* `python`: specific to the [Python client library](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-python)

## Helpers

These folders contain some helpful re-useable items when working with the
client libraries:

* `flux`: pre-written [Flux](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/) scripts
  for easy re-use
* `influxdb`: Scripts to start up a local InfluxDB instance with a known set
  of credentials
