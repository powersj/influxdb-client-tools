# InfluxDB Client Tools

This is my collection of helper scripts to interact with InfluxDB via the
client libraries. Here is a break down of each folder:

* `python`: specific to the Python client library
* `flux`: pre-written flux scripts
* `influxdb`: Scripts to start up a local InfluxDB instance with a known set
  of credentials.
